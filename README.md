# Garden Logger

I have a personal note taking system I call my Garden Log, this tool is one I'm writing to help manage and use my note taking system. I keep my notes in raw markdown that I edit with neovim where I can, and obsidian where I can't.

I'm also partially using this as an excuse to learn Go.
